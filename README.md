# SimpleJavaEvents
A clean, easy-to-use, strongly-typed implementation of the Observer pattern for Java

Synchronous and asynchronous event firing, unlimited subscribing and unsubscribing, and easy management.
Declare any number of events per class, and pass strongly typed event arguments with your events.
Think C# events, with optional automatic asynchronous dispatching.
